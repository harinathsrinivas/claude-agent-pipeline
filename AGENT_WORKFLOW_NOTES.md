# Agent Workflow Notes

Notes on this multi-agent workflow (the agents in the `claude-agent-pipeline` plugin). Not an agent definition — kept out of `agents/` so it isn't scanned as one.

## Opus 4.8 + effort migration (2026-05-30)

Migrated all 8 agents to the Opus 4.8 / effort-tier model.

Each agent now declares an `effort:` frontmatter field (`low | medium | high | xhigh | max`; omitting it inherits session effort). Assignments:

| Agent            | Model  | Effort |
| :--------------- | :----- | :----- |
| planner          | opus   | high   |
| orchestrator     | opus   | high   |
| architect        | opus   | high   |
| judge            | opus   | high   |
| executor-opus    | opus   | max    |
| executor-sonnet  | sonnet | medium |
| executor-haiku   | haiku  | low    |
| git-agent        | haiku  | low    |

`model: opus` is kept as an alias (auto-resolves to the latest Opus, currently 4.8) rather than pinned to `claude-opus-4-8`, so configs track future upgrades.

### Per-step effort = "Hybrid advisory" design
The Task/Agent tool has **no per-invocation effort parameter** (open upstream: claude-code issues #25669, #43083, #31536). Effort can only be set via static frontmatter or session `/effort`. So:
- The planner tags each step with both `[model: ...]` and an **advisory** `[effort: ...]`.
- The orchestrator routes by `[model: ...]` (which determines the real runtime effort, since each executor's effort is fixed in frontmatter), notes any effort mismatch, and reports under-powered steps in its final summary.
- Reliable way to deliver high/xhigh/max thinking today: assign `[model: opus]` (runs at `max`).
- **Revisit when upstream adds a per-call effort param** — at that point the orchestrator can honor `[effort: ...]` directly and we can drop the model-as-effort-proxy coupling.

## Deferred: Opus 4.8 "dynamic workflows"

Opus 4.8 added **dynamic workflows** — a session plans a task then spins up *hundreds* of parallel subagents in one session, with outputs verified before being reported back. Potentially a much stronger backbone than the current sequential orchestrator + multi-candidate worktrees.

**Blocker for our current design:** subagents cannot spawn subagents, and our `orchestrator` *is* a subagent. Dynamic workflows is a main-session capability. Exploiting it would mean restructuring so the orchestrator drives from the main session (e.g. via `--agent orchestrator`) rather than being spawned as a subagent.

**Status:** DECIDED 2026-06-03 — adopt top-level orchestration (the restructuring this note flagged). See below.

## Decision (2026-06-03): top-level orchestration + no-silent-handling

The depth-1 limit was confirmed in practice across multiple runs: a spawned `orchestrator` found `Task` unavailable and silently fell back to running every step inline (noting it only in `STATUS.md`). Two changes:

1. **Execution model = top-level orchestration.** The pipeline runs in the MAIN session, not as a spawned `orchestrator` sub-agent. The main session reads `PLAN.md` and follows the `orchestrator` agent's definition as a *playbook*, spawning the executor / candidate / judge / git sub-agents itself (depth-1 from the main session works), committing between steps, and pausing at the human gates. Do NOT launch `orchestrator` via `Task` to execute a plan — that reproduces the depth-1 problem. `orchestrator.md` is retained as the canonical playbook + spawn-context-packaging spec.

2. **No silent handling of fundamental contradictions.** If any agent (or the main session) hits a fundamental capability gap or contradiction vs. the plan — a needed tool is unavailable, a planned approach is impossible, an instruction conflicts with a hard runtime limit — it must STOP and surface an explicit DECISION REQUEST to the user (what was expected, what differs, the options) instead of quietly degrading. The earlier inline fallback is exactly what this forbids. Mirrored in `CLAUDE.md`.

Not changed: sub-agent nesting depth is a Claude Code runtime cap with **no project setting** — we don't attempt to configure one (the `orchestrator` already lists `Task` in its tools; the repo was never the blocker).
